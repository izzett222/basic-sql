# SQL Fundamentals: Literals, Expressions & SELECT

## How These Exercises Work

Each exercise gives you a set of raw data values. Your job is to write SQL
queries that process that data step by step. Each part builds on the previous one, you must use the literal values you got from running the previous query as your inputs for the next query.

## Exercise 1: Patient Health Record

**You are given this raw patient data:**

| Field           | Value   |
| --------------- | ------- |
| First name      | `'john'`  |
| Last name       | `'doe'`   |
| Age             | `28`      |
| Weight (kg)     | `85`      |
| Height (cm)     | `175`     |
| Temperature (C) | `38.5`    |

### Part A
Write a SELECT that displays the raw patient data as it is.
### Part B
Write a SELECT that displays:
- The patient full name in uppercase
- The patient age
- The patient weight converted to pounds
- The patient height converted to meters
- The patient temperature converted to fahrenheit

**Constraints**
- You cannot write the full name as a single string literal
- You must use string expressions to build the full name
- You must use `UPPER()`
### Part C
Using the **results you got from Part B** as your literal values, write a
SELECT that displays:
- The patient full name in uppercase
- The patient BMI rounded to 2 decimal places
- The patient temperature in fahrenheit
- Whether the patient has a fever (temperature above 100.4)

**Constraints**
- BMI formula: `weight_pounds / (height_meters * height_meters) * 703`
- You cannot use `TRUE` or `FALSE` for the fever flag directly, you must compute it from the values 

### Part D
Using the **results you got from Part C** as your literal values, write a SELECT that displays:
- The patient full name in uppercase
- The patient BMI
- Whether the patient is overweight (BMI above 25)

- A health tag that combines the uppercase full name with `'- AT RISK'` or `'- HEALTHY'` based on the results from Part C

**Constraints**
- You cannot use `TRUE` or `FALSE` for any flag directly
- The patient is AT RISK if they are overweight OR have a fever
